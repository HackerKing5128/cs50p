# Caesar Cipher Project

## Video Demo: [Click Here]()

---

## Description:

This Python project implements a Caesar cipher for both encryption and decryption. The Caesar cipher is a basic monoalphabetic substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet (A to Z) based on a specified key. The key is an integer from 0 to 25, determining the rotation value.
